# CompositeWorks
CompositeWorks is a simple set of Lua and Python scripts that work in tandem in order to achieve a universal way to send and receive Composite data over HTTP in [Stormworks: Build and Rescue](https://store.steampowered.com/app/573090/Stormworks_Build_and_Rescue/).

Pre-built Microcontrollers can be found at [Releases](https://github.com/jonasCCa/CompositeWorks/releases).

## Dependencies
* [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask/), for the Server that'll listen to requests from the spawned Microcontrollers.
